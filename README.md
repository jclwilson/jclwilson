# Former writer turned coder

Junior Software Engineer with a background in digital media. In January, 2025, I enrolled at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), a selective, intensive London-based bootcamp designed for career-switchers. I chose the software engineering and DevOps tracks to complement my previous experience in front-end design.

On the 16-week, full-time, on-site course, I gained practical experience in group work, paired programming, agile project development, TDD, Python, AWS, and CI/CD workflows. On the DevOps specialism track, I gained practical experience with DevOps tools including Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I'm now teaching myself TypeScript, Node.js, and Vue.js.

With a background in arts and culture writing, I have great experience discovering solutions to real world problems through interviews, communication, collaboration, and receiving and delivering feedback and turning news into compelling stories. I am creative, curious, highly adaptable and willing to put the work in to grow my knowledge and optimise my work.

I'm open for work as of [May 2025](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/eventedit?text=Time+to+hire+Jacob+Wilson&dates=20250514T000000Z/20250515T000000Z&details=%3Ch2%3EJacob+Wilson+has+graduated+from+Makers+London%20%3C/h2%3E%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3EVirtual%20backgrounds!%3C/li%3E%20%3Cli%3ESilly%20stories!%3C/li%3E%3Cli%3ESnacks!%3C/li%3E%20%3C/ul%3E%3Cp%3EYou%20can%20message%20him%20%20%3Ca%20href=%22mailto:hello@jacobcharleswilson.com%3C/a%3E%3C/p%3E
